# Crowdfunding Analytics Dashboard

Hi! 👋  
I’m Rahul, an aspiring Data Analyst with a background in Electrical & Electronics Engineering (VIT). I transitioned into Data Analytics after completing professional training at ExcelR. This project represents my hands-on journey of learning how to convert raw data into meaningful business insights.

This project focuses on analyzing crowdfunding campaigns to understand what makes projects successful, how funding behaves across categories and countries, and how data can support better decision-making.

## 🔍 What This Project Is About
Crowdfunding platforms generate a huge amount of data, but raw data alone doesn’t tell a story. In this project, I worked on:
- Cleaning and preparing messy datasets in Excel  
- Writing SQL queries to calculate KPIs and validate data  
- Building interactive dashboards in Power BI and Tableau  
- Presenting insights clearly through a business-focused presentation  

The goal was not just to create dashboards, but to understand trends, patterns, and real business problems.
